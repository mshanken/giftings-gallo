Complimenting the bravado of Bear Flag, the 2015 MacMurray Estate Vineyards Russian River Valley Pinot Noir is a masterful blend with soft, round, delicate flavors. The offering is sourced primarily from four of MacMurry’s Russian River Valley Vineyards. More than two-thirds of the fruit was selected from the MacMurray Ranch Vineyard, where the Pinot Noir basked in the sun of the vineyard’s upper valley to ripen and offer traces of dark cherry flavors, and Two Rock Vineyard, which contributed complex fruit and autumn woods accented with delicate and mellow oak notes from barrel aging.
