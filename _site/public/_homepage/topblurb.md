<span class="text-primary text-underline">The Kraft Wrap:</span> For a modern rustic touch, use chalkboard or butcher paper, chalk or pen, a ribbon, and bakerâ€™s twine. Evoke the feeling of a special offering from a refined yet laid-back California wine country restaurant. Try this with the bold *2016 Bear Flag Zinfandel or the farmhouse chic 2015 MacMurray Estate Vineyards Russian River Valley Pinot Noir*.

<span class="text-primary text-underline">The Minimalist Gift-Wrap:</span> For a simple yet polished style that complements any bottle, select the wrapping paper design of your choice to create a band that allows your recipients to be delighted when they unwrap to reveal the label. Try this with the understated *2016 Talbott Vineyards Kali Hart Chardonnay*.

<span class="text-primary text-underline">The Dinner Napkin:</span> For a touch of elegance that lets your recipient know that this bottle is truly special, use a cloth dinner napkin and a ribbon. Try this with these classic Napa Valley wines: *2015 Louis M. Martini Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon* and *2016 William Hill Estate Winery Napa Valley Chardonnay*. Double or triple your gift to result in a complete set of napkins.

For each wrapping style above, you can add a decorative accent such as greenery or a bow to the bottleneck along with one of these four holiday tags.

Make each bottle of fine wine your special way of sharing tidings of comfort and joy this season!
