The 2016 Bear Flag Zinfandel embodies the rugged independent spirit of early California settlers who rebelled against tyranny and fought for independence in 1846 and inspired the Golden State’s motto, “Eureka!” Bear Flag celebrates forward thinking individuals prepared to do whatever it takes to achieve their dreams. Sourced primarily from Sonoma County’s distinguished Dry Creek Valley, the wine is complex with a pinch of spice, vanilla, and dark fruit elegance. Full-bodied yet supple, Bear Flag stands tall as its namesake and is well-structured with an All-American backbone. This bold wine has blueberry and blackberry flavors and is balanced with a toasty oak aroma and satisfying level of acidity. Bear Flag Zinfandel’s rich bouquet and finish is sure to please the palates and warm the hearts of all who partake.
